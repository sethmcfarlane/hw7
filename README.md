A couple issues:

1. I'm not sure how to make the balls bounce off the blocks of the xylophone.

2. I'm having a wierd problem with a loop crashing the whole thing. I think it's a brainfart thing but I'll show you on Monday.

3. I would like to create an imaginary circle around the origin of the line where your mouse can't drag past. Not sure how to do this.
